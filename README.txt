Collection of various testbenches and programs used for modeling of 
digital filter behavior, in particular the behavior of the Goertzel algorithm
in the context of an RFSoC FPGA module.

Data generated with C++, plotted with Gnuplot. For running these programs in VS Code,
the DSP/.vscode/tasks.json file was used to configure compilation with g++.

DSP.h is my personal library, which contains quite a few functions and digital filters
that have been necessary in writing the main programs.

The majority of the content (code, plots, images, scripts) within this repository are
created for the purpose of data analysis relating to my undergraduate thesis:
"Resource-Efficient DFTs via the Goertzel Algorithm for Continuous-Wave Detection with FPGAs"
